Hello this is Halim Kareh's project.

I've added new features to the To Do List app:

	1.The Headings P, Perc, and Due Date (Priority, Percentage of Completion, Due Date) which alow the user
		 to have a more detailled explanation of his tasks to complete.

	2. All kinds of sorting methods(By completion, By percentage, By priority, Alphabetically).

	3. A function that checks the whole list rather than item by item.

	4. Printing of the list to a text file (Suggested by you guys:))
